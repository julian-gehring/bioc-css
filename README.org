#+TITLE: Bioconductor CSS

This is an idea for a CSS stylesheet in line with the Bioconductor design (see
also the [[http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BiocStyle.html][BiocStyle]] package).  It is based on the stylesheet of the [[hhttp://orgmode.org/worg/][worg]]
project and lives under the same license.
