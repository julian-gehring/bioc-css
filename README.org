#+TITLE: Techniques and Styles for HTML Vignettes


* Styles

The =bioc.css= is a CSS stylesheet for HTML vignettes.  It has been designed to
be in line with the Bioconductor design for PDF vignettes (see also the
[[http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BiocStyle.html][BiocStyle]] package).  The CSS code is based on the stylesheet of the [[hhttp://orgmode.org/worg/][worg]] project
and lives under the same license.

Here are examples of vignettes that are based on this style:

- [[http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/SomaticSignatures/inst/doc/SomaticSignatures-vignette.html][SomaticSignatures]]
- [[http://master.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/h5vc/inst/doc/h5vc.tour.html][h5vc]]

  
* Techniques

In order to include a CSS stylesheet automatically in a knitr HTML vignette, add
this code to the vignette:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  library(knitr)

  ## Import the style from CSS file 'css_path' 
  style = paste(readLines(css_path), collapse = "\n")

  opts_knit$set(self.contained = TRUE,
                upload.fun = image_uri, ## optional
                header = c(highlight = style))
#+END_SRC
